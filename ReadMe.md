# Towards Eavedropped Image Denoising

## Practical Work 1 -- PW1 -- Basics of Image Processing and Denoising

Subject --> [PW1.html](./PW1.html) 

### 1. Image Manipulations
In this section, you will use some basics code lines to manipulate images.

### 2. Synthetic Image Noising and Quality Assessement
In this section you will experience synthetic image noising and quality assessment. For that end, the scikit-image python package is used.

### 3. Denoising Using Basic Filtering
In this section you will take a step towards denoising. Basic filtering will be used and the quality measured and observed to highlight the limits of such basic processings. 

## 4. Advanced Filtering
In this section, you will experiment an example of advanced filtering. This method, while more efficient, is also more dedicated. You will see that it does not adapt well to noise distributions slightly different from what the method is made for. 

## Practical Work 2 -- PW2 -- State of the Art Methods for Denoising and Application to Eavesdropped Image Interpretation

### 1. Prototyping a Learning-Based Denoising Method

### 2. Application to Eavesdropping Interpretation
