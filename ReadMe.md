# Towards Eavedropped Image Denoising

## Practical Work 1 -- PW1 -- Basics of Image Processing and Denoising

Subject --> [PW1.html](./PW1.html) 

### 1. Image Manipulations
In this section, you will use some basics code lines to manipulate images.

### 2. Synthetic Image Noising and Quality Assessement
In this section you will experience synthetic image noising and quality assessment. For that end, the scikit-image python package is used.

### 3. Denoising Using Basic Filtering
In this section you will take a step towards denoising. Basic filtering will be used and the quality measured and observed to highlight the limits of such basic processings.
